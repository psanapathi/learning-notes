title: Cryptocurrencies, App Coins, and Investing in Protocols
---
Cryptocurrencies have exploded. The platform is also inherently open, and democratized by default. The blockchain paradigm has a very good trust validation model. It is basically a swarm of decentralized, and incentivized economic actors - growing the blockchain is in everyone's best financial interest. Hedge funds are looking to invest in the protocol itself. This encourages for the platform to be kept open instead of walled off ecosystems. In this way, value accrues to the user, and not any centralized authority. The exchange itself is decentralized - like a decentralized NASDAQ. Decisions are taken by the public and not in closed boardrooms. App coins is gaining in popularity: a monetary layer is added to the p2p network. Tokens are like a currency. Whole new asset classes are being created - thanks to bitcoin and Ethereum. The language for Ethereum scripts is Turing complete. Allows developers and users to create powerful features for the end user on top of the platform. Another approach is creating a system of smart contracts to create a stable coin, whose value can be pegged to the dollar. Still very early stage - remains to be seen where the platform goes from here.
