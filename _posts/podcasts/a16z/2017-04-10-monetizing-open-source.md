title: Monetizing Open Source (Or, All Enterprise Software)
---
Open source is growing. However, present open source companies cater too much to users and not enough to enterprises. Yes, building a user community is important, but you cannot use the same strategy to take the product commercial. Commoditizing the previous generation doesn't work anymore. You need to catch the next big revolutionary change in the enterprise and capitalize on that. Commoditizing restricts you to a fraction of the market. A big change today is that cloud is changing the way enterprises work. Customers now want to consume as a service. Open source companies should also have a differentiating factor and be able to claim the lion's share of the market supply. Otherwise, big companies (and even other competitors) can very easily overpower you. Also, as an open source company, enterprises can just download your product off the internet. You should become a part of the extended team of the company as your expertise is valued. You should create value right from the top. This has led to open source's intrinsic benefits being recognized. Today, any new software company has to be open source. That's how the landscape is.
