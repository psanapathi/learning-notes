**04/17/2017 - A Simple Shift for Your Email Inbox Strategy**

We get a lot of emails every day. This podcast is about how to build an effective email strategy. One must look at emails as a more real-time communication tool - like texting, or talking in real life. There is one tip for senders and one tip for receivers. Senders should clearly identify their call to action in the email and accordingly craft their emails. There shouldn't be any open-ended questions as that will delay response times. Receivers should either immediately respond to emails or do necessary research and remember to respond (using a todo list) for easy management. The aim is to treat emails like tools of communication and not as tasks on a todo list.

He also asks the iPhone users to put such apps in a folder to have that extra step and cause friction before opening an app.

**03/24/2017 - Using Substitute Questions to Gain a Better Perspective**

For any question we are asked, the human mind substitutes it with a more digestible version to enable us to process it. These are called substitute questions. To enhance our understanding and perspectives, we must ask ourselves different types of substitute questions when confronted with a problem. This will enable us to gain a higher degree of confidence in our answers.
