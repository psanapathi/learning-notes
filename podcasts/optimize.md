**04/17/2017 - New +1: Keep Shooting**

This is a story about [Karoly Takacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1roly_Tak%C3%A1cs). A world class shooter, he lost his shooting hand - his right hand before the championships. He practised with his left hand, and won the world championships in 1939. The Olympics of 1940 and 1944 were canceled, and Takacs won the gold medal in the 1948 Olympics, to the surprise of everyone. The lesson here is to *keep shooting*, whatever the circumstances may be.

**04/10/2017 - New +1: +1 or -1 = Destiny Math**

Abraham Maslow studied the greatest people of our generation and said, "What one CAN be, one *must* be". Self-actualization is a need as basic as food and shelter. Life is a series of decisions and at each step, you decide whether you want to move forward and grow (+1), or stay still and be comfortable (-1). This series of decisions aggregates and compounds over time, and shapes our lives.

**01/24/2017 - Interview: The Leadership Challenge with Jim Kouzes**

Jim Kouzes talks about the leadership challenge. He says it is a challenge because people always talk about overcoming adversity when asked about their personal best. Simply put, pressure makes diamonds. He talks about the 5 most important leadership principles:

* Practice what you preach
* Envision a future and think long term
* Challenge the process. Innovate and take risks.
* Collaborate with other people.
* Encourage yourself and others.

When people were asked for the qualities they look forward in a leader they would willingly follow, four came to the forefront: honesty, competence, forward-looking, inspirational. Another important tenet is credibility. It is the very foundation of leadership. More the credibility, more the engagement. Remember! DWYSYWD - Do What You Say You Will Do. And all this is empirically backed. There is no *hand-waving*. All people exhibit these qualities. But what matters is how frequently you exhibit. Leaders engage in such behavior more often than not. Incremental optimizations aggregate and compound over time. A leader is like the sunlight that shines down to clear the fog. Their vision extends beyond the horizon.

At the end of the day, your LIFE is the lessons, ideas, feelings, and evidence you leave behind. It is your legacy. We always have to move beyond our boundaries to achieve extraordinary greatness. Adversity introduces us to ourselves. Always be mindful of your environment and your surroundings. It is important to never turn your back on the ocean!
