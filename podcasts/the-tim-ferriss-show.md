**03/25/2017 - The Secrets, Tactics, and Creative Processes of High Performers and Achievers -- Debbie Millman**

Debbie Millman answers listener's questions on this episode. About stability vs opportunity - humans are naturally hardwired to lead stable lives and resist change. We should push ourselves to recognize opportunity and take the leap - because that is satisfying. Another interesting thing was avoiding the impostor syndrome - everyone suffers from it; it is our prerogative to see what we can do and do that! Also, write out whatever you want to do in your alternative lives - photographer, painter, etc. Then you pick one and run with it. As you progress through life, goals may change, and you may choose different paths.
