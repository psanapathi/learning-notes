**04/10/2017 - Monetizing Open Source (Or, All Enterprise Software)**

Open source is growing. However, present open source companies cater too much to users and not enough to enterprises. Yes, building a user community is important, but you cannot use the same strategy to take the product commercial. Commoditizing the previous generation doesn't work anymore. You need to catch the next big revolutionary change in the enterprise and capitalize on that. Commoditizing restricts you to a fraction of the market. A big change today is that cloud is changing the way enterprises work. Customers now want to consume as a service. Open source companies should also have a differentiating factor and be able to claim the lion's share of the market supply. Otherwise, big companies (and even other competitors) can very easily overpower you. Also, as an open source company, enterprises can just download your product off the internet. You should become a part of the extended team of the company as your expertise is valued. You should create value right from the top. This has led to open source's intrinsic benefits being recognized. Today, any new software company has to be open source. That's how the landscape is.

**04/03/2017 - Cryptocurrencies, App Coins, and Investing in Protocols**

Cryptocurrencies have exploded. The platform is also inherently open, and democratized by default. The blockchain paradigm has a very good trust validation model. It is basically a swarm of decentralized, and incentivized economic actors - growing the blockchain is in everyone's best financial interest. Hedge funds are looking to invest in the protocol itself. This encourages for the platform to be kept open instead of walled off ecosystems. In this way, value accrues to the user, and not any centralized authority. The exchange itself is decentralized - like a decentralized NASDAQ. Decisions are taken by the public and not in closed boardrooms. App coins is gaining in popularity: a monetary layer is added to the p2p network. Tokens are like a currency. Whole new asset classes are being created - thanks to bitcoin and Ethereum. The language for Ethereum scripts is Turing complete. Allows developers and users to create powerful features for the end user on top of the platform. Another approach is creating a system of smart contracts to create a stable coin, whose value can be pegged to the dollar. Still very early stage - remains to be seen where the platform goes from here.

**03/17/2017 - The Product Edge in Machine Learning Startups**

This session was moderated by Steven Sinofsky and founders of 2 prominent machine learning-based startups came. Question on hand is how can smaller companies compete and win when the bigger companies have easier access to very large datasets. Key takeaways - lot of sectors where big companies are not interested; quality of data, not quantity, is at times more important. It is not just the data and the algorithm, the whole package and how the product is developed is what is important. Another advice was not to reinvent the wheel and use existing frameworks and infrastructure (to start shipping and iterating quickly).

**03/13/2017 - Build Your Personal Brand**

Brand is not fame - a common misconception. Your personal brand is how people perceive you, what they think of you based on what you do and what others talk about you. It defines your aspirations and where you want to go to next.
