**04/09/2017 - Instacart: Apoorva Mehta**

Apoorva Mehta worked at Amazon but always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He left his job and went to San Francisco, and started working on his ideas. They weren't successful and he realized that it is because he never really put his heart in it. One day, he realized that he always hated buying groceries - the entire process. He came up with this idea of getting groceries delivered from existing grocery stores. And thus, Instacart was born. His friends started using the product out of their own interest rather than as a favor for a friend and the app organically grew. Its differentiation against other competitors in this space was its lack of inventory and wider variety of groceries. Partnership with a large number of chains helped to make the total price (price + delivery) competitive.

After a point, he needed to raise more funds. Apoorva missed the YC deadline and also got rejected with a late application. He realized that nobody actually used his app. He ordered a 6-pack of beer to Y Combinator's headquarters. That made them sit up and take notice. Instacart was eventually accepted after an interview.

Being a technology company, Instacart is uniquely poised to handle technological challenges which Safeway or Whole Foods can't take care of as it is not their forte. Although he feels a roller coaster of emotions everyday, and lot of challenges crop up, the fact that customers use and *enjoy* his product keeps him going.

His final parting shot is that for a startup to be successful, timing is everything. Not too early, and not too late. And of course, luck won't hurt.
