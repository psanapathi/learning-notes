* Data can be continuous or discrete, qualitative or quantitative, categorical/nominal or ordinal, interval or ratio.
* Continuous vs discrete data:
  * Discrete data has no in-between values.
  * Distinct either/or results in discrete data.
  * Values with increments in between measures continuous data.
