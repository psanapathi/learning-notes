## Introduction to UX

* UX - how a person feels when using an app.
* Good UX make users happy.
* UX design studies the processes of a system.
* UX looks at many components:
  * Design
  * Usability
  * Accessibility
  * Marketing
  * System performance
  * Utility
* Everyone on a team should work for the UX.
* UI is different as it includes the visual design.
* Focusing too much on details initially only optimizes locally.
* Important to get the big picture first.
* UX helps an app stand out from the rest.

## Why should PMs understand UX?

As a PM, your role is pretty interdisciplinary and you collaborate with designers, engineers,testers and other managers at your organization. Understanding the basics of UX won't only help you communicate with your UX designers but will also enable you to build user centric and creative products. 

This (UI/UX) section of the program will introduce you to some concepts, tools and techniques used by UX designers. You don't need to become a UX expert but you should try to get a feel for the key ideas driving UX research. 

The main steps in the User Experience journey are as follows:

* Gathering Information & Domain research (know your competitors and domain)
* User research (know your user)
* Creating Personas (a persona is a fictional example of your user)
* Brainstorming & creating User Journeys (know your user interactions with your product)
* Wireframing (build a very simple & visual representation of your user interface)
* Building Mockups (add colors and personality to your wireframes)
* Prototyping (make your mockups interactive and dynamic)
* Testing, Iterating and Improving (keep learning!)

## UI vs UX

* UI is:
  * A tool.
  * A point of interaction.
  * A means of communication between person and system.
* UX:
  * Is the interaction itself.
  * Includes interfaces.
  * Addresses all aspects of a thing as perceived by a person.
* All together:
  * Content is what people are looking for.
  * UI is the tool that serves it up.
  * UX is the consumption.
* UX is the why for any design decision.
* Good UX is the manifestation of deeply understanding people.
* UXers do exploratory deep dives through interviews, content/IA audits, analytics analyses, usability testing, and competitive analyses.
* This results in guiding design documents such as personas, messaging frameworks, experience maps, sitemaps, sketches, wireframes, storyboards, etc.
* UX people interpret client questions as shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratnala/learning-notes/master/moocs/feelthelearn-product-manager/tuning-your-ux-ear.png).
* A good UX asks what do you want to achieve rather than what do you want to make.

## Data & Decisions - Data informed decision making

* Decision making is a balance between experience, intuition and data.
* How much to rely on data and how much to rely on instinct is a tradeoff.
* Focusing solely on intuition and experience - ignoring external inputs and analyses. Our experience also suffers from cognitive and emotional biases.
* Blindly following data leads to ignoring your experiences. Datasets are not perfect.
* Need to find a middle ground - data informed decision making. Blend of human experience and data.
* Companies taking a data informed approach to decision making have 4% higher productivity and 6% higher profits.
