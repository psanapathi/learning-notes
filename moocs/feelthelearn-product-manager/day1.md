## Introduction to UX

* UX - how a person feels when using an app.
* Good UX make users happy.
* UX design studies the processes of a system.
* UX looks at many components:
  * Design
  * Usability
  * Accessibility
  * Marketing
  * System performance
  * Utility
* Everyone on a team should work for the UX.
* UI is different as it includes the visual design.
* Focusing too much on details initially only optimizes locally.
* Important to get the big picture first.
* UX helps an app stand out from the rest.

## UI vs UX

* UI is:
  * A tool.
  * A point of interaction.
  * A means of communication between person and system.
* UX:
  * Is the interaction itself.
  * Includes interfaces.
  * Addresses all aspects of a thing as perceived by a person.
* All together:
  * Content is what people are looking for.
  * UI is the tool that serves it up.
  * UX is the consumption.
* UX is the why for any design decision.
* Good UX is the manifestation of deeply understanding people.
* UXers do exploratory deep dives through interviews, content/IA audits, analytics analyses, usability testing, and competitive analyses.
* This results in guiding design documents such as personas, messaging frameworks, experience maps, sitemaps, sketches, wireframes, storyboards, etc.
* UX people interpret client questions as shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratnala/learning-notes/master/moocs/feelthelearn-product-manager/tuning-your-ux-ear.png).
* A good UX asks what do you want to achieve rather than what do you want to make.
* What a good UX wants to achieve is shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratnala/learning-notes/master/moocs/feelthelearn-product-manager/ux-goals.png).

## Data & Decisions - Data informed decision making

* Decision making is a balance between experience, intuition and data.
* How much to rely on data and how much to rely on instinct is a tradeoff.
* Focusing solely on intuition and experience - ignoring external inputs and analyses. Our experience also suffers from cognitive and emotional biases.
* Blindly following data leads to ignoring your experiences. Datasets are not perfect.
* Need to find a middle ground - data informed decision making. Blend of human experience and data.
* Companies taking a data informed approach to decision making have 4% higher productivity and 6% higher profits.
